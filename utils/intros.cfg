It is a tale of civilisations, heroes and heroines from a long-gone aeon: it tells of King Abhai III of Garet-Desh, the owner of the fabled Rod of Justice; of the great dragon Shek'har, father of Shek'kahan and Krahkrahs; of High Ascendant Maat, goddess amongst humans; of the Aragwaithi people, once paramount amongst the humans of the Great Continent...

Daughter of an Aragwaith woman and a man from the eastern steppes, she spent most of her childhood in a small village in the Aragwaith Meadows. Her life there was never happy, for she was often bullied by other villagers due to her mixed heritage and to her mother being single. When the latter died, the young Myra fled the place, venturing into the Southern Wilderness; and there, she would have been killed by wild beasts or nomadic drake bands, hadn't Maat found her."

Before leaving, she asked King Abhai III, her close friend, to send some troops to the Windy Mountains, for she feared some dark deed was on the way. A few weeks passed, but nothing else happened; and in the Valley of Hashira, Myra anxiously waited for her foster mother's return while studying as the pupil of Lashimi, headmistress of the Windsong haven (or school) in the region. And it is there that our tale begins, with the onset of what would be known as the Last War..."

The king's castle was surprisingly simple, with little embellishment, but it looked like a fortress capable of withstanding the heaviest and longest sieges. The dwarf king sat on his throne in a great room, flanked by his many children and the most trusted warriors; Aiglur bowed to him and introduced the Windsong girls.
